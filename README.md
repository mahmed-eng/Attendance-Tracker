# Student Selection:
The user can select a student from the dropdown menu. When a student is selected, the date and time input fields become enabled, allowing the user to input attendance details.

# Date and Time Input:
Once a student is selected, the date and time input fields become active.
The user can select the date of attendance using a date picker.
The user can input the in and out times using time pickers. These fields are initially disabled until a student is chosen.

# Time Difference Calculation:
As the user inputs the in and out times, JavaScript calculates the time difference between them.
If both in and out times are provided, the script calculates the difference and displays it below the time input fields.

# Saving Attendance:
When the user clicks the "Save Attendance" button, the script retrieves the selected student, date, in time, and out time.
It performs validation to ensure that all required fields are filled.
If any required field is empty, an error message is displayed, prompting the user to fill in all fields.
If all fields are filled, the attendance data is logged to the console. In a real-world scenario, this data could be sent to a server for storage and further processing.

# Taking Snapshot:
The "Take Snapshot" button allows the user to capture a screenshot of the attendance form.
When clicked, the button temporarily hides itself to avoid appearing in the screenshot.
After a short delay, the script captures the screenshot using the dom-to-image library.
The screenshot is then downloaded as an image file (attendance_snapshot.png).

# Error Handling:
If the user attempts to save attendance without filling in all required fields, an error message is displayed.
This ensures that incomplete data is not processed and prompts the user to provide all necessary information.
